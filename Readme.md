Product summary (what does it do)
Mission of the "Next Book Please" website:

Help readers to discover the correct reading order of fiction series.
 
Inspiration: As a fan of genre fiction, I have frequently had to spend an inordinate amount time doing research to discover the correct order in which to read a series. Amazon only provides this information in a piecemeal and inconsistent fashion. Sometimes I have found it in forums on Amazon, sometimes on author websites or Wikipedia. This application seeks to provide a better solution to that problem.

Audience target
Fans of genre fiction, e.g. fantasy, science fiction, urban fantasy, mysteries, westerns, historic fiction, etc.

Targeted devices and browsers
Chrome

Expectation of strengths (easy things)
Possibly creating a data model that works well in firebase, but that remains to be seen, as I have no experience with no sql databases.

Having worked through an existing application that does the same thing in Rails, I have some existing domain knowledge, research, and data as a starting point. 

Expectation of challenges (things you want to learn, or difficult)
Clearing some of the conceptual hurdles of learning Angular. Improving my comfort level with core JavaScript. Working with a NoSql data store will be a new experience.

Future goals (if any) for project
End goal - An Amazon Affiliate web store based on the concept of good information regarding Fiction series.
Other goals - evaluate Angular, Firebase data storage, and Firebase hosting against Rails/Heroku as technology choice for moving forward with the project.
